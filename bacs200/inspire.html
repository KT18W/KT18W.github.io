<h2>A Person Who Inspires Me</h2>
<p>The only person who is not a character in a T.V. show that inspires me is Elon Musk.
    In all reality you can never truly see to the core of who a person really is, especially historical or public figures.
    It reminds me of a saying, I don't know if I have the words right but, "Never meet your heros, they will just dissapoint you".
    Which is why I have never really had a hero that is someone that everyone knows because you never really know them.
    Therefore I have based my selection upon accomplishment in a feild that I beleive to be worth while. There are a lot
    of things to do on this planet and a lot of them are worth while, but the feild that inspires me is space exploration.
    There is a lot of inventions, new frontiers, and thinking about how the future may be someday. Elon Musk has contributed a lot 
    to the feild even if he is not the mind behind all of the science. He is the one that beleived in his dream and created Space-X.
    Which he kept pursuing even after there was such a great financial risk that most sane people would have gave up and ran away. 
    But since he did not, a lot of scientific progress has been made such as reusable rockets. Not only that but he is 
    engineering the future of vehicals and saftey standards, and is doing a lot of work in the feild of AI. He is creating the
    future. He has a dream of what he wants the future to look like, and he is making it happen. He wants to colonize Mars, and that 
    is a lot to accomplish, which makes a heck ton of room for scientists to do there thing. It is a dream that allows people to dream 
    about the future and how far we could one day get. Colonizing Mars is a goal that reminds people that we haven't discovered
    everything. That there is so much yet we can learn. It is something that can fuel the imagination, and inspire people to do what
    they beleive in, instead of just going to a mediocre average 9-5 job everyday until they are too old to do anything and then retire 
    and sit at home wishing they had done something while they had the energy and the youth to do it. That is why Elon Musk inspires me.
